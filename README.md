# STA-141B-Final-Project
This GitHub repository contains the Python Notebook and all necessary datasets that were used in obtaining and analyzing musical data across the decades. 
## Python Notebook 
The notebook contains all code associated with our research. There are several functions contained within, such as: generating access tokens, extracting all tracks and their advanced data from a playlist, extracting audio features from a track, querying a search within the Spotify API, generating CSV files of dataframes, plotting datasets, and creating an interactive app to plot datasets. 
### !!Important!! App Execution 
In order to run the app, please run the first code cell before running. Otherwise, the inline Bokeh plots will not generate. Thank you and enjoy! 
## Audio Features Datasets 
These are Spotify's provided audio features datasets from 2019. They contain thousands of songs, the artist, Spotify URI, and audio features. 
## Additional CSV Files 
These contain the cleaned dataframes produced by code from the Python Notebook. Within each are the top 100 songs of that decade from its respective database, the artists associated with the song, the Spotify song ID, release dates (and precision), and audio features.
